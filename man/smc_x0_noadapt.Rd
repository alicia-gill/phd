list containing: birth rate, prevalence, proportion observed, maximum birth rate, linear gaussian variance, acceptance rate, run time in seconds, smc log-likelihood and optimal number of particles
}
\description{
Implements an SMC-MCMC with adaptive resampling when the epidemic with birth rate varying over time has been partially observed with known proportion. MH adaptation of shape and scale of rho and sigma. Unknown optimum number of particles.
