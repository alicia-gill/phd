}
\arguments{
\item{iter}{number of iterations to run the algorithm for.}

\item{max_time}{maximum number of seconds to run the algorithm for.}

\item{max_birth_rate0}{initial value of the maximum birth rate.}

\item{sigma0}{initial value of the linear gaussian standard deviation.}

\item{proportion_obs0}{initial value of the proportion of cases observed.}

\item{death_rate}{death rate of the epidemic.}

\item{ptree}{object of class phylo.}

\item{noisy_prevalence}{data frame of observed prevalence per day.}

\item{n_particles}{number of particles used in the importance sampling.}

\item{ess_threshold}{threshold of ESS below which triggers resampling.}

\item{print}{logical; if TRUE, prints percentage of the way through the chain.}
}
\value{
list containing: birth rate, prevalence, acceptance rate, run time in seconds
}
\description{
Implements an SMC-MCMC with adaptive resampling when the epidemic with birth rate varying over time has been partially observed with known proportion.
